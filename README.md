### Number Guesser
**Number Guessing Game**

### Description
A simple Python-based number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within specified bounds. The game provides feedback to help the player adjust their guesses.

### Features
- Allows the player to set the lower and upper bounds for the guessing range.
- Generates a random number within the specified bounds.
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- Tracks the number of attempts made to guess the correct number.

### Installation
To run the game locally, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repository
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```sh
   python number_guessing_game.py
   ```

### Usage
1. Upon starting the game, you will be prompted to enter the lower and upper bounds for the number range.
2. The game will then generate a random number within this range.
3. Enter your guesses when prompted. The game will inform you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Continue guessing until you find the correct number. The game will display the total number of attempts.

### Example
```
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
Enter the lower bound: 1
Enter the upper bound: 100
Guess the number: 50
Too high!
Guess the number: 25
